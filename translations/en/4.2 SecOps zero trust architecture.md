# SecOps Zero Trust Architecture

[![Watch the video](../../translated_images/4-2_placeholder.20e2345a0848364aaf73ddda28f676a3d9980843c51a0050774b268037db079d.en.png)](https://learn-video.azurefd.net/vod/player?id=8a2c36d9-8117-4576-ad5b-787667d13603)

Security operations are a key part of zero trust architecture, and in this lesson, we will explore two main aspects:

- How should IT architectures be designed to enable centralized log collection?

- What are the best practices for security operations in modern IT environments?

## How should IT architectures be designed to enable centralized log collection?

Centralized log collection is a vital element of modern security operations. It enables organizations to gather logs and data from various sources, such as servers, applications, network devices, and security tools, into a single repository for analysis, monitoring, and incident response. Below are some best practices for designing IT architectures to support centralized log collection:

1. **Log Source Integration**:

- Ensure all relevant devices and systems are configured to generate logs. This includes servers, firewalls, routers, switches, applications, and security appliances.

- Set up log sources to forward logs to a centralized log collector or management system.

2. **Choose the right SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tool**:

- Select a SIEM solution that fits your organization's requirements and scale.

- Verify that the chosen solution supports log collection, aggregation, analysis, and reporting.

3. **Scalability and Redundancy**:

- Design the architecture to scale as the number of log sources and log volume grows.

- Incorporate redundancy to ensure high availability and prevent disruptions caused by hardware or network failures.

4. **Secure Log Transport**:

- Use secure protocols like TLS/SSL or IPsec to transmit logs from sources to the centralized repository.

- Implement authentication and access controls to ensure only authorized devices can send logs.

5. **Normalization**:

- Standardize log formats and normalize data to ensure consistency and simplify analysis.

6. **Storage and Retention**:

- Define the appropriate retention period for logs based on compliance and security needs.

- Store logs securely to protect them from unauthorized access and tampering.

## What are the best practices for security operations in modern IT environments?

Beyond centralized log collection, here are some best practices for security operations in modern IT environments:

1. **Continuous Monitoring**: Continuously monitor network and system activities to detect and respond to threats in real time.

2. **Threat Intelligence**: Stay updated on emerging threats and vulnerabilities by using threat intelligence feeds and services.

3. **User Training**: Provide regular security awareness training to employees to reduce risks from social engineering and phishing attacks.

4. **Incident Response Plan**: Create and test an incident response plan to ensure a quick and effective reaction to security incidents.

5. **Security Automation**: Use security automation and orchestration tools to streamline incident response and repetitive tasks.

6. **Backup and Recovery**: Implement strong backup and disaster recovery solutions to ensure data availability in the event of data loss or ransomware attacks.
